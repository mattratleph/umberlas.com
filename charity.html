      <h2>Charity.</h2>
      <p>We make art because we think it has the potential to make an impact in people's lives. We're doers and that's why we raise money, not to just give it away, but to accomplish real projects. We'd like to bring you along for the ride.</p>

      <h3>Christmas Project: 2012</h3>
      <img src="img/charity/christmas.png" alt="Christmas Project" width="450" height="250">
      <p>Sometimes we take Christmas for granted. We assume that each family is able to celebrate with good food and fun presents. We assume that Christmas is a day of joy and remembrance for everyone. Not every family is that fortunate, and so we hope to break down a couple barriers for them through providing food and gifts.</p>
